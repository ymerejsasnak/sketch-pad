#JS Sketch Pad (from the Odin Project)

This is the first project I completed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.  I will likely be leaving it as is since it doesn't seem worth working on for any practical reason.

####Possible additions/improvements:
*try optional additions from odinproject (random colors, incremental colors, change grid resolution)
*didn't know about color picker element when I made it, that would be better than 3 sliders for the color
*disable click and drag selection which sometimes messes up the painting
