sketch-pad
==========

-did basic sketch pad in about two hours
-changed it so you have to click and drag to paint instead of just hover (like a real paint program)
(but this seems to cause an issue sometimes where clicking and dragging selects elements on the page)

to do:
-try optional additions from odinproject (random colors, incremental colors, change grid size)
-maybe add other things like flood fill button, color selection button, etc.
-***try to fix above issue with selecting elements...find way to turn it off?
